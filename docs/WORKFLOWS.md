## Payment Flow

### Overview

ArtisanLink uses M-Pesa STK Push for payments. Clients pay the platform, and artisans receive automatic payouts via M-Pesa B2C.

### Deposit Payment Flow

```
Client initiates → STK Push to phone → Client enters PIN → Callback received → Artisan payout created
```

#### 1. Initiate Payment

**Client Actions:**
- On job page, clicks "Pay Deposit"
- Confirms phone number

**API Route:** `POST /api/payments/job/initiate`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jobId": "job_123",
  "paymentType": "DEPOSIT",
  "phoneNumber": "254712345678"
}
```

**System Actions:**
- Validates job status (must be `ACCEPTED`)
- Creates `Payment` record with `status: INITIATED`
- Calls M-Pesa STK Push API
- Returns checkout request ID

#### 2. M-Pesa STK Push

**User Experience:**
- Push notification appears on phone
- Displays: Business name, Amount
- User enters M-Pesa PIN

**Possible Outcomes:**
- **Success** - Payment processed
- **Cancelled** - User cancelled/timeout
- **Failed** - Insufficient funds, wrong PIN, etc.

#### 3. Callback Processing

**M-Pesa sends callback to:** `POST /api/payments/job/callback`

**On Success:**
- `Payment.status` → `COMPLETED`
- `Payment.mpesaReceiptNumber` stored
- `Job.status` → `DEPOSIT_PAID`
- `Job.depositPaidAt` set

**Payment Distribution (Deposit):**
```
Client pays: KES 10,000 (50% deposit)
├── 80% (KES 8,000) → ArtisanPayout created (PENDING)
└── 20% (KES 2,000) → Job.heldAmount (escrow)
```

**On Failure:**
- `Payment.status` → `FAILED`
- `Payment.failureReason` stored
- Client notified, can retry

### Final Payment Flow

Same process as deposit, with different distribution:

**Payment Distribution (Final):**
```
Client pays: KES 10,000 (remaining 50%)
Total job value: KES 20,000

Commission calculation:
├── If promotional (first 5 jobs): 5% of KES 20,000 = KES 1,000
└── If standard: 10% of KES 20,000 = KES 2,000

Artisan receives (with 10% commission):
├── Final payment: KES 10,000
├── Plus held amount: KES 2,000
├── Minus commission: KES 2,000
└── Net payout: KES 10,000

Platform records:
├── ArtisanPayout: KES 10,000
└── PlatformEarning: KES 2,000
```

### Payment Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| INITIATED | STK Push sent, awaiting user |
| COMPLETED | Payment successful |
| FAILED | Payment failed |
| CANCELLED | User cancelled |

### Database Models Involved

## Payout Processing

### Overview

Artisan payouts are processed via M-Pesa B2C (Business to Customer). Payouts are queued and processed in batches by a cron job.

### Payout Creation

Payouts are created automatically when:
1. **Deposit paid** - 80% of deposit amount
2. **Final payment** - Remaining balance minus commission

### Payout Processing Flow

```
Payout created (PENDING) → Cron job picks up → B2C initiated (PROCESSING) → Callback received → COMPLETED/FAILED
```

#### 1. Cron Job

**Runs:** Hourly (or configurable)
**API Route:** `GET /api/cron/process-payouts`

**Actions:**
- Fetches PENDING payouts where `nextRetryAt <= now`
- Initiates B2C for each
- Updates status to PROCESSING

#### 2. B2C Processing

**For each payout:**
- Generate unique request ID
- Call M-Pesa B2C API
- Send to artisan's registered phone

**B2C Request includes:**
- Amount
- Phone number
- Remarks (job reference)

#### 3. Callback Handling

**M-Pesa sends callback to:** `POST /api/payments/b2c/result`

**On Success:**
- `ArtisanPayout.status` → `COMPLETED`
- `ArtisanPayout.mpesaReceiptNumber` stored
- `ArtisanPayout.completedAt` set
- If final payment: `User.completedJobCount` incremented

**On Failure:**
- `ArtisanPayout.status` → `FAILED`
- `ArtisanPayout.failureReason` stored
- `ArtisanPayout.retryCount` incremented
- `ArtisanPayout.nextRetryAt` calculated

### Retry Strategy

| Retry | Delay |
|-------|-------|
| 1 | 5 minutes |
| 2 | 30 minutes |
| 3 | 2 hours |
| >3 | Manual review required |

**After 3 failures:**
- `requiresManualReview` → `true`
- Admin notified
- Appears in admin payout dashboard

### Admin Payout Management

**Admin Dashboard:** `/admin-dashboard/payouts`

**Actions available:**
- **Retry** - Reset for immediate retry
- **Cancel** - Cancel payout
- **Mark Complete** - Manual completion (external payment)
- **Add Notes** - Record information

**Use cases for manual intervention:**
- Wrong phone number → Admin updates, retries
- M-Pesa system issues → Wait and retry
- Fraudulent activity → Cancel with notes

### Payout Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| PENDING | Awaiting processing |
| PROCESSING | B2C initiated |
| COMPLETED | Successfully sent |
| FAILED | Send failed |
| CANCELLED | Cancelled by admin |

### Database Models Involved
- `ArtisanPayout` - Payout record with retry tracking

2. Enters/confirms phone number
3. STK Push sent
4. Artisan enters PIN
5. Callback received

**On Success:**
- `Subscription` created/extended
- `Subscription.startDate` set
- `Subscription.endDate` calculated
- `Subscription.status` → `ACTIVE`

### Subscription Statuses

## Commission Structure

### Rates

| Type | Rate | Applies To |
|------|------|-----------|
| Promotional | 5% | First 5 completed jobs per artisan |
| Subscriber | 5% | Active subscription holders (permanently) |
| Standard | 10% | All jobs after promotional period |

### Calculation

Commission is calculated on the total job value (deposit + final payment).

**Example (KES 20,000 job with standard 10%):**
```
Total job value: KES 20,000
Commission: KES 2,000
Artisan receives: KES 18,000

Breakdown:
├── Deposit (50%): KES 10,000
│   ├── To artisan: KES 8,000 (80%)
│   └── Held: KES 2,000 (20%)
│
└── Final (50%): KES 10,000
    ├── Plus held: KES 2,000
    ├── Total available: KES 12,000
    ├── Commission: KES 2,000
    └── Net to artisan: KES 10,000

Total to artisan: KES 8,000 + KES 10,000 = KES 18,000
```

### Tracking

- Earnings dashboard shows:
  - Total earnings

## Error Handling

### Payment Failures

| Error | User Action | System Action |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Insufficient funds | Add funds, retry | Show error, allow retry |
| Wrong PIN | Retry | Auto-cancel after 3 attempts |
| Timeout | Retry | Show timeout message |
| M-Pesa down | Wait, retry later | Queue for retry |

### Payout Failures

| Error | Admin Action | System Action |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Invalid phone | Update phone, retry | Flag for review |
| Recipient limit | Wait, retry | Schedule next day |
| B2C system error | Wait, retry | Auto-retry with backoff |

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Payment Callbacks**
   - Validate callback origin (IP whitelist)
   - Verify transaction details match initiated request
   - Use HTTPS only

2. **Payout Authorization**
   - Admin-only manual actions
   - Audit trail for all payout actions
   - Rate limiting on B2C calls

3. **Data Protection**
   - Phone numbers encrypted at rest
   - PCI compliance for payment data
   - GDPR-compliant data handling
